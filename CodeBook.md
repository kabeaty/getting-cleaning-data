## Variables

The following variables are used in the data frame returned by the get_averages function in the run_analysis.R script. This data frame is a manipulation of the original data set described [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

* Subject  
  Subject is the name of the first column in the data set. It uses the numbers 1 through 30 to refer to the 30 training and test subjects.

* Activity  
  Activity is the name of the second column in the data set. It uses the activity labels included in the original data set's activity_labels.txt file to identify the activities, as these were sufficiently descriptive.

* AvgTBodyAccMeanX  
  AvgTBodyAccMeanX is the name of the third column in the data set. It is based on the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the mean body acceleration in the X direction for each subject and activity combination.

* AvgTBodyAccMeanY  
  AvgTBodyAccMeanY is the name of the fourth column in the data set. It is based the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the mean body acceleration in the Y direction for each subject and activity combination.

* AvgTBodyAccMeanZ  
  AvgTBodyAccMeanZ is the name of the fifth column in the data set. It is based on the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the mean body acceleration in the Z direction for each subject and activity combination.

* AvgTBodyAccStdX  
  AvgTBodyAccStdX is the name of the sixth column in the data set. It is based on the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the standard deviation for body acceleration in the X direction for each subject and activity combination.

* AvgTBodyAccStdY  
  AvgTBodyAccStdY is the name of the seventh column in the data set. It is based on the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the standard deviation for body acceleration in the Y direction for each subject and activity combination.

* AvgTBodyAccStdZ  
  AvgTBodyAccStdZ is the name of the eighth column in the data set. It is based on the feature vector names found in the original data set's features.txt. This refers to the average of the standard deviation for body acceleration in the Z direction for each subject and activity combination.
